## About the Book
This book satisfies any IT professional's desire to become a successful ethical hacker who is willing to be employed in identifying and exploiting flaws in the organization's network environment. This book explains in detail how to conduct wireless penetration tests using a wide variety of tools to simulate cyber attacks on both Android and iOS mobile devices and wireless networks.
 
This book walks you through the steps of wireless penetration testing from start to finish. Once Kali Linux has been installed on your laptop, as demonstrated, you will check the system requirements and install the wireless adapter. The book then explores the wireless LAN reconnaissance phase, which outlines the WEP and WPA/WPA2 security protocols and shows real-world attacks against them using Kali Linux tools like Aircrack-ng. Then, the book discusses the most recent and sophisticated cyberattacks that target access points and wireless devices and how to prepare a compelling and professionally presented report.
 
As a bonus, it removes myths, addresses misconceptions, and corrects common misunderstandings that can be detrimental to one's professional credentials. Tips and advice that are easy to implement and can increase their marketability as a pentester are also provided, allowing them to quickly advance toward a satisfying career in the field.
